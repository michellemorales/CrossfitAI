"Lift for Life PH"-A Unified and Global Effort for the Survivors Devastated by Typhoon Yolanda
Nov 7, 2013, Typhoon Yolanda made landfall in the Visayan region of The Philippine Islands. It has been dubbed as the biggest and strongest typhoon to make landfall in recorded history. Thousands are estimated to have died and it is unlikely they will ever know the exact total of deaths.
We are joining the CrossFit community around the world in support of the Philippines for a fundraiser WOD named YOLANDA.

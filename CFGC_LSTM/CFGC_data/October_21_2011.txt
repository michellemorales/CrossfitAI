CFGC Warmup x 3 sets in 20 minutes:Squat/Hip Ext: 1 round of DB complex from workoutPull: PullupsPush: Ring DipsHip Flexion: GHD Situp
Training
5 sets:
3 rounds of the following DB complex:5 x DB Deadlift5 x DB Hang Power Clean5 x DB Thruster
Rest 3-5 minutes b/w sets.
One set constitutes 3 rounds of the full complex (45 reps total). Once you begin your first Deadlift, the DBs cannot rest on the ground until all 3 rounds are completed. You can rest anywhere else (DBs at hang, DBs on shoulder, etc.).
If you are successful on your first set, you MUST increase weight on your second set, so on and so forth. If you fail, attempt the same weight again on your next set. If you fail twice at a weight, go lighter on your next set.
Perform 5 sets. These are NOT for time. The goal is max weight used over the course of the 5 sets.
Post heaviest successful set to comments.

Notes
The Partner on the Rower is the rabbit. Once they finish their 250 meters, everyone rotates up one station. You may only row while your partner is holding the bar over their head. If the partner holding the bar over their head brings the bar down to rest, the partner on the rower must stop until they bring the bar back overhead.
If you are a team of 2, follow the same format when one of you is on the rower and one is on the barbell. When no one is on the rower, the partner holding the bar overhead must accumulate 1 minute in that position before rotating.

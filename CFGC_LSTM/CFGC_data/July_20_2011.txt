For time: 100 Burpee Pull-Ups
Ideally, the pull-up bar is one foot above your reach.
Scaling Options:

If pullup bar is more than one foot above your reach, place a plate(s) on the ground, step on the plate(s) and then jump to the bar and perform your pullup.
If unable to perform pullups, set up a pair of rings so the bottom of the ring is at wrist level and perform 100 Burpee Jumping Pullups. (Burpee > Stand and Grab Rings > Jumping Pullup > Repeat).
If you can jump to the pullup bar but cannot perform the pullup, perform the burpee, jump up to the pullup bar and perform a knees to elbows.
Scale the reps so this takes no longer than 25 minutes.

For example, you finish up with 8 SDHP and 6 Push Presses in the first 5 minute AMRAP. You then rest 5 minutes. The next 5 minute AMRAP is done in reverse - you start with 6 Push Presses, then 8 SDHP, 7 Push Presses, 7 SDHP...back down as far as possible in 5 minutes. The goal is to get all the way back to 1 rep of each.
If you finish all reps before the 5 minutes are up...you are done!

Partner up with 2 people of similar strength. Each of you begins at a different station. You each complete 6 sets of 30 sec on/30 sec off at your station. After the 6th set, everyone rotates up one station and completes 6 sets at station 2...and then at station 3.
Goal is to sustain your output for all 6 sets. Shoot for about 85% effort across the board rather than 100% in the first set, 90% in the 2nd, 80% in the third...so on and so forth.

Workout of the Day
"Hope"
Three rounds of: Burpees Power Snatch (75/55) Box jump (24"/20") Thruster (75/55) Chest to bar Pull-ups
"Hope" has the same format as Fight Gone Bad.  In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute.  This is a     five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed  before     repeating. The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On  call     of "rotate," the athlete/s must move to next station immediately  for     good score. One point is given for each rep.
Scaling options will be provided in class.

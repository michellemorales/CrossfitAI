Workout of the Day
Warmup:
3 sets of:
7 x [Deadlift + Hang Power Clean + Front Squat + Push Jerk]
Start with an empty bar and increase weight each set.
Partner up, stretch shoulders/hips while your partner works.
Training:
5 sets for max weight of the following complex:
7 rounds of1 x Deadlift1 x Hang Power Clean1 x Front Squat1 x Push Jerk
Rest 3-5 minutes b/w sets.
Once you begin your set, there is no resting the bar on the ground. You may rest at the hang, on the shoulders, etc.
If you complete all 7 rounds without resting, you MUST increase weight on the next set.
If you fail, either attempt the same weight again (if you just barely failed) or decrease weight (if failed very badly) on the next set.

Notes
Front Squat

Goal is 5 TOUGH sets.
First set should be at 75-80% of 1RM.
Goal is to increase weight on each set and build to 5RM for day
Remain strict on tempo and range of motion. If unable to maintain tempo and/or ROM, do not increase weight.

Pullups

Pullups are style of your choice. Kipping, strict, underhand, overhand, etc. Pick one and stick with it for all 5 sets.
If you need band assistance, pick a band that allows for 10-15 reps in your first set.

Scaling/Notes
L-Sit Pullups: Any grip is acceptable. If unable to perform L-Sit Pullup, perform Strict Pullups. If unable to perform Strict Pullups, perform Max L-Sit Hold from the hang position. Scale leg position accordingly (2 legs straight, 1 leg straight, bent knees, etc.)
Ring Dips: If unable to perform Ring Dips, perform Ring Pushups. If unable to perform Ring Dips/Pushups, perform Max Hold in top of Ring Pushup position (straight, rigid body...no sagging!).
Hip Extensions: Hold DB across chest. Ensure full range of motion, especially at top. If unable to achieve full range, set is terminated. Lower under control every rep. No pausing at bottom.

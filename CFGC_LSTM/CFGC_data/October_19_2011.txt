Clean & Jerk - Find your 2 rep max in 15-20 minutes (see Garage Games workout #1 for rules)
The 2 rep max you achieve today will determine your starting point for Saturday.

Treat this as an opportunity to feel this combination of movements. Be aware of which movements are hardest for you. Perform each movement at game pace. If able to move through fairly quickly and easily, rest 90 seconds and perform a second set. If struggling at any point, just perform 1 set.

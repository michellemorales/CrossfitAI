Push Presses: Use approx 70% of 3 rep maxPullups: If unable to achieve chest to bar, complete chin over bar. If unable to complete pullups, substitute 10 Jumping Pullups.
Notes:
Partner up with someone of similar strength so you can share a bar for the Push Presses.
If an odd number of people show up and someone is without a partner, complete 4 rounds of 500 meter row and AMRAP PP/Pullup for as long as it takes you to complete the 500 meter row. So, if it takes you 2 minutes to complete the first 500 meter row, complete AMRAP PP/PU for 2 minutes and so on each round.

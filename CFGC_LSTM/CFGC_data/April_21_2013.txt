CrossFit Games Open 11.3
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 5 minutes of: 165/110 pound Squat clean  165/110 pound Jerk
In this movement, the  barbell goes from ground to overhead with the  athlete passing through a  full squat position while the barbell is  racked on the shoulders. This  can be a full-squat-clean-thruster, a   power-clean-front-squat-split-jerk, or anything in between as long as   the three key positions are reached. The barbell begins on the ground.   Touch and go is permitted. No bouncing. The athlete must pass through a   full squat with hips below knees. The barbell must come to full lockout   overhead with the hips, knees and arms fully extended, and the bar   directly over the heels.

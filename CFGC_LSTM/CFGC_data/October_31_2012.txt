This can be a full-squat-clean-thruster, a  power-clean-front-squat-split-jerk, or anything in between as long as  the three key positions are reached. The barbell begins on the ground.  Touch and go is permitted. No bouncing. The athlete must pass through a  full squat with hips below knees. The barbell must come to full lockout  overhead with the hips, knees and arms fully extended, and the bar  directly over the heels.

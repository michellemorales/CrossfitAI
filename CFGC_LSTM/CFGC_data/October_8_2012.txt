Notes

Goal is to perform all 5 rounds unbroken with as much weight as possible
If you are successful, you MUST increase weight on the next set
If you fail, complete the set and remain at that weight on the next set
If you fail a weight twice, decrease the weight on the next set

Post heaviest unbroken set to comments.
